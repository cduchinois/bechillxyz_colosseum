# CHILL Onboarding Conversation Flow

---

**Start**
chill helps you get control over your crypto — and stay calm doing it.
[ get started ]

---

**Q1 — Greet + Name**
chill:
hey. i'm chill — your crypto peace coach.
what should i call you?

*User types name → Store as `user.name`*

---

**Q2 — Pick a Goal**
chill:
nice to meet you, [name].
what's your main goal with crypto?

Buttons:
[ secure my wealth ] [ grow it steadily ] [ take big risks ]

*Store answer as `user.goal`*

---

**Q3 — Get Wallet**
chill:
got it. to help you stay on track, i need to look at your portfolio.
i don't track or store anything — just analyze and give insights.
this is all local, all yours.

Buttons:
[ connect wallet ] [ paste address ] [ skip ]

*Store answer as `user.walletSource`*

---

**If Skipped:**
chill:
ok, no stress. i'll show you an example with a public wallet.
this one belongs to a trader who wanted to grow steadily...

(delay 1 sec)

...but they've got 88% in altcoins. high volatility, no backup.
not really what you'd call "steady growth", right?

*Use sample portfolio for demo*

---

**Q4 — Analyze + Insight**
- If real wallet: Run analytics on user portfolio (call `runAnalytics.ts`).
- Delay chat for 5–7 sec to simulate scan.
- Retrieve relevant compliance/FAQ/behavioral rules if needed (RAG).
- LLM output for analysis:

chill:
scanning your assets...
checking for concentration, risk, and behavior...

(then)

chill:
(give analysis: e.g., "You have 60% in ETH, 30% in stablecoins, 10% in altcoins. Your portfolio is moderately diversified, but could be more balanced for your goal.")

---

**If Yes (User wants advice/action):**
chill:
(give advice: e.g., "Suggestion: move 10% of [token] to a stablecoin — same potential, lower chaos. Want me to remind you later too?")
[ do it / save suggestion ]

- If "do it": Call on-chain stub (`runOnChain.ts`).
- If "save suggestion": Store suggestion in session.

---

**Q5 — Chill Score**
chill:
based on what I saw, your current chill score is xx
a bit chaotic — but now you know. / or it's already quite chill
let's work on raising it together.
